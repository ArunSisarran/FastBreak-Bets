# FastBreak Bets

FastBreak Bets is a sports betting assistant that uses the NBA API to fetch up-to-date information about user-specified teams and players to generate more accurate betting parlays. The project combines a Flask backend with a React frontend and integrates a machine learning model to suggest betting parlays based on previous game data.

### Note:
- This application requires you to host the backend on your local machine. Due to the slow nature of third party free backend hosting websites, local hosting will make the app feel much more responsive.
- Access the frontend at `fast-break-bets.vercel.app`

## Features

- Fetch real-time NBA data using the `nba_api`
- Search for players and teams through the frontend interface
- View current league standings
- (In progress) Machine learning model to generate:
  - Likely parlay (safe bet)
  - Risky parlay (high potential reward)

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- Flask
- nba\_api
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

### Frontend

- React
- Next.js
- Vercel
- npm
- CSS

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (npm)
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArunSisarran/FastBreakBets.git
   cd FastBreakBets
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
   venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask backend:
   ```bash
   cd src/Backend/
   python server.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Access the frontend at `fast-break-bets.vercel.app`
2. Search for players or teams using the search bar
3. View league standings
4. Generate likely or risky parlays based on past game data (upcoming)

## Machine Learning

The machine learning model uses historical game data to predict possible parlays. The model is trained using Scikit-learn and includes:

- Feature selection for player performance metrics
- Logistic Regression
